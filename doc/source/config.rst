Configuration
=============

1. Setup Your Shell Environment
_______________________________

These are environment variables that either :term:`DRMAA`, cosmos, or :term:`Django` require.  You can set them by pasting the commands below into your terminal,
or by putting them at the end of your ``~/.bashrc`` if you'd like them to be executed automatially everytime you login.  You must modify the
first two lines.

Settings DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH to the correct :file:`libdrmaa.so` is very system and :term:`DRMS` dependent.  Try locations such as these:

* :file:`/opt/lsf/7.0/linux2.6-glibc2.3-x86_64/lib/libdrmaa.so`
* :file:`/usr/lib/libdrmaa.so`
* :file:`/opt/sge6/lib/linux-x64/libdrmaa.so`

.. code-block:: sh

   export COSMOS_HOME_PATH=/path/to/Cosmos          # The path to Cosmos
   export DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/libdrmaa.so   # The path to the :term:`DRMAA` library
   export COSMOS_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.default
   export PYTHONPATH=$COSMOS_HOME_PATH:$PYTHONPATH
   export PATH=$COSMOS_HOME_PATH/bin:$PATH
   source $COSMOS_HOME_PATH/venv/bin/activate       # automatically enable virtual environment

``COSMOS_SETTING_MODULE`` is optional.  By default, cosmos will look for its configuration in ``$COSMOS_HOME_PATH/config/default.py``,
but if you set ``COSMOS_SETTING_MODULE=config.development`` it will load ``$COSMOS_HOME_PATH/config/development.py`` instead.

SGE specific environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also need to set (if they're not already) normal :term:`SGE` job submission variables such as:

.. code-block:: bash

	SGE_ROOT=/opt/sge6/lib/linux-x64/libdrmaa.so
	SGE_EXECD_PORT=63232
	SGE_QMASTER_PORT=63231
   

LSF specific environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following bypasses a bug in :term:`LSF` drmaa v1.04.

.. code-block:: bash

   export LSF_DRMAA_CONF=$COSMOS_HOME_PATH/lsf_drmaa.conf
   

2. Edit Configuration File
__________________________

Edit :file:`config/default.py`, and configure it to your liking.  There are only a few variables to set.

3. Create SQL Tables and Load Static Files
__________________________________________

Once you've configured Cosmos, setting up the SQL database tables is easy.  :term:`Django` also requires you to run the collectstatic
command, which moves all the necessary image, css, and javascript files to the static/ directory.  Just run these two commands for any directory after you've properly
configured the environment variables described in step #1.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cosmos adm syncdb
   $ manage collectstatic
