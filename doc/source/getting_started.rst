Getting Started
===============

We'll start by running a simple test workflow, exploring it via the web interface, and terminating.  Then
you'll be ready to start your own.

Command Line Interface
______________________

Make sure your environment variables, are set.  In particular :file:`/path/to/Cosmos/bin` must be in your PATH
Use the shell command :command:`env` if you're not sure what's in your environment.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cosmos -h
   usage: cli.py [-h] {adm,wf} ...
   
   positional arguments:
     {adm,wf}
       adm       Admin
       wf        Workflow
   
   optional arguments:
     -h, --help  show this help message and exit
         
Explore the available commands, using -h if you wish.  Or see the :doc:`cli` for more info.  Note that when
listing workflows, the number beside each Workflow inside brackets, `[#]`, is the ID of that object.


Execute the Test Workflow
_________________________
   
The console will generate a lot of output as the workflow runs.  This workflow tests out various
features of Cosmos.  Again, the number beside each object inside brackets, `[#]`, is the ID of that object.

.. code-block:: generic

Launch the Web Interface
________________________

You can use the web interface to explore the history and debug all workflows.  To start it, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   cosmos adm runweb
  

.. note:: Currently the system you're running the web interface on must be the same you're running the workflow on.
   
Visit http://your-ip:8080 to access it.

Terminating a Workflow
______________________

Currently, we do not support pressing ctrl+c (coming soon!) to terminate a workflow.  *Avoid pressing ctrl+c while a workflow is running!*
If you do, Cosmos will not be able to properly update the database.  It will be fine when you restart things, but for example, your latest batch
will still have the status of "in_progress" instead of "failed".

To terminate a workflow properly, first find it's ID:

.. code-block:: bash

   #Get the ID of the workflow
   $ cosmos wf listcosmos wf list
   Workflow[3] Terminate Me
   Workflow[5] My other Workflow
   
Then, use the workflow's id to terminate it:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cosmos wf terminate 1
   Telling Workflow[3] Terminate Me to terminate
   WARNING: 2012-09-27 17:01:14: Terminating this workflow...
   Request <14182> is being terminated
